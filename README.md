# Smartphone_Price_Prediction
I have developed a dataset on hardware and software properties of mobile which contains 9 columns
BATTERY	 | RAM | PPI | INT.MEM | EXT.MEM | F.CAM | R.CAM | DISP |	PRICE
-------  | --- | --- | ------- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ----- 
4000 |2 |	294 |	32 | 128 | 5 | 8 | 15.90 | 7800 

__BATTERY__ is in milliamp Hour

__RAM__ is in GB

__PPI__  -  Pixel per inch

__INT.MEM__  - Internal Memory in GB

__EXR.MEM__  -  Expandable Memory in GB

__F.CAM__ - Front Camera in megapixel

__R.CAM__  - Rear Camera in megapixel

__DISP__  - Display size in cm

__PRICE__ in INR

The first 8 columns are used as independent variables . 

Using this our model predicts the price (dependent variable ) using **LINEAR REGRESSION**.
